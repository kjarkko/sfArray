created the string radix sort function, just need to make it not cause a segmentation fault.

at the moment the radix sort function is the root of all evil, I have spent more hours trying to fix it than what I can recall.

As mentioned above, I have spent the whole week simply trying to get the radix sort fuction to work.
So far the function has managed to segfault in every way imaginable, and I also believe that at one point it had also managed to write thrash into the stack in memory adresses used by another function.

I did manage to start analysing the time complexity of the functions.
